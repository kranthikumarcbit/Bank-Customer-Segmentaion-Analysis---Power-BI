# Bank-Customer-Segmentaion-Analysis---Power-BI
Power BI Dashboard Visualization on Bank Customer dataset


"""Bank Customer Segmentation & Insights Dashboard!"""

I built a complete end-to-end analytics solution covering:

Transaction behavior analysis

Customer segmentation (New, Loyal, Regular, Lost)

Demographic & geographic insights

Risk-level profiling with credit score & account balance trends

Profitability indicators to support data-driven decisions

The dashboards reveal:

1.43bn total revenue analyzed

Strong insights into customer age groups & transaction patterns

Clear segmentation patterns to help improve retention

High-risk customer identification and credit behavior trends

Actionable metrics for marketing, risk teams, and business strategy

This project strengthened my skills in:

Power BI (DAX, data modeling, drill-throughs, interactive pages)

Data cleaning & transformation

Creating business-driven visual stories

Segmentation logic & customer analytics

I'm excited to keep growing in Data Analytics, BI Development, and Data Science.
